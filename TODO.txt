- Fix character and npc coupling with animation and other stuff (probably use components for coupling features)
- Fix player shadow
- Try to pre-bake shadows to mape tiles, or do something when they spawn
- Load next tile in parallel to avoid load hickups
- Create load screen and play after load of first map tiles
- Review AI (encapsulate and refactor)
- Add player inertia to ball projectiles
